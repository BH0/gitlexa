# Gitlexa [Prototype] 
A simple Alexa Skill made using NodeJS to give users an easier and conveniant method of being reminded about version control topics. 

Uses AWS Lambda function/s. 

Skill was made using the "Fact" template but has been personalized. 
[
    ask new --template 
    fact
]

Admiteddly I need to use better wording to improve the experience but this is a start.  
And so far only the US region is supported. 

#### Some example utterances [can be found in en-US.json]: 
ask gitlexafour how do i know what a commit changed 
ask gitlexafour who uses git
