# Gitlexa [Prototype] 
A simple Alexa Skill made using NodeJS to give users an easier and conveniant method of being reminded about version control topics. 

Skill was made using the "Fact" template but has been personalized. 
[
    ask new --template 
    fact
]

Admiteddly I need to use better wording to improve the experience but this is a start.  
And so far only the US region is supported.
